 * 
 * Which of the following is true about above code?
 * 
 * <p>
 * C. In this code, instead of using the locks, we could use synchronization for
 * providing thread safety. </br>
 * Option C is correct as the using the lock objects we can provide the thread
 * safety like using synchronization.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * D. If we used synchronization instead of locks then this code will perform
 * more efficiently in multi threading environment. </br>
 * Option D is incorrect as synchronization is less efficient when compare to
 * locks.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * E. Locking and unlocking will not provide thread safety for set and get
 * operations. </br>
 * Option E is incorrect as here, locking and the unlocking operations provide
 * the tread safety by acquiring locks when itï¿½s needed.
 * </p>
